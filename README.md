# The-Guardian
It's difficult to keep a track of all the on-going things in my life. So, it'd be good if someone helps me to do that. I won't care if I'd have to give all my life details to him/her but I want that someone to make my life a little bit simpler by keeping a check over me at all times. I want that someone to know if I'm wasting my time browsing through irrelevant stuff over the net or if I am not able to maintain proper balance between work, health and fun. It seems like I need a **Guardian**.

This project involves building an Artificially Intelligent Program which shall keep a check over my activities and take necessary actions to improve my life. (Not only my life, anyone's life who uses it :D)
